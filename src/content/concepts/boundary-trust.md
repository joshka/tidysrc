## Boundary job

A boundary should translate uncertainty into a contract. Raw request data, database rows,
environment variables, and third-party responses should not keep their raw shape after code has
enough context to parse them.

The next layer should receive a value it can trust or a structured error it can handle.

## Failure mode

When boundaries only pass data through, validation, defaults, error handling, and layer vocabulary
spread across callers. That creates drift and makes small rules expensive to change.

## Examples

### Low-level example

The concept becomes visible when the caller uses a named boundary instead of repeating a hidden rule.

```c title="src/example.c"
if (approval_policy_can_approve(policy, user, request)) {
    approve_request(request);
}
```

### Object example

The object caller keeps the decision behind a named boundary.

```cpp title="src/example.cpp"
if (approval_policy.can_approve(user, request)) {
    approvals.approve(request);
}
```

### Service example

The service calls a named policy instead of rebuilding the rule.

```csharp title="Approvals/ApprovalService.cs"
if (approvalPolicy.CanApprove(user, request))
{
    approvals.Approve(request);
}
```

### Boundary example

The boundary owns the decision the caller depends on.

```go title="internal/approvals/service.go"
if approvalPolicy.CanApprove(user, request) {
    approvals.Approve(request)
}
```

### Policy example

The caller asks a named policy for the decision.

```java title="src/main/java/example/Approvals.java"
if (approvalPolicy.canApprove(user, request)) {
    approvals.approve(request);
}
```

### Client example

The client keeps the rule behind a named boundary.

```js title="src/approvals.js"
if (approvalPolicy.canApprove(user, request)) {
  approve(request);
}
```

### Function example

The function delegates the rule to a named boundary.

```python title="approvals.py"
if approval_policy.can_approve(user, request):
    approvals.approve(request)
```

### Type example

The caller asks a named policy instead of rebuilding the condition.

```rust title="src/approvals.rs"
if approval_policy.can_approve(user, request) {
    approvals.approve(request);
}
```

### Typed example

The typed caller uses the named policy boundary.

```ts title="src/approvals.ts"
if (approvalPolicy.canApprove(user, request)) {
  approvals.approve(request);
}
```
