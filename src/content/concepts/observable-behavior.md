## Why it matters

Refactors should be able to change private shape without breaking tests. Behavior tests should fail
when callers would see a different result, error, event, or side effect.

In legacy code, characterization tests document what happens today. Follow-up changes can decide
which quirks to preserve or intentionally change.

## What counts

Observable surfaces include return values, errors, logs at boundaries, events, files, network calls,
persisted records, generated HTML, and public API behavior.

Private helper calls are observable only when the helper is itself a contract or integration seam.

## Examples

### Low-level example

The concept becomes visible when the caller uses a named boundary instead of repeating a hidden rule.

```c title="src/example.c"
if (approval_policy_can_approve(policy, user, request)) {
    approve_request(request);
}
```

### Object example

The object caller keeps the decision behind a named boundary.

```cpp title="src/example.cpp"
if (approval_policy.can_approve(user, request)) {
    approvals.approve(request);
}
```

### Service example

The service calls a named policy instead of rebuilding the rule.

```csharp title="Approvals/ApprovalService.cs"
if (approvalPolicy.CanApprove(user, request))
{
    approvals.Approve(request);
}
```

### Boundary example

The boundary owns the decision the caller depends on.

```go title="internal/approvals/service.go"
if approvalPolicy.CanApprove(user, request) {
    approvals.Approve(request)
}
```

### Policy example

The caller asks a named policy for the decision.

```java title="src/main/java/example/Approvals.java"
if (approvalPolicy.canApprove(user, request)) {
    approvals.approve(request);
}
```

### Client example

The client keeps the rule behind a named boundary.

```js title="src/approvals.js"
if (approvalPolicy.canApprove(user, request)) {
  approve(request);
}
```

### Function example

The function delegates the rule to a named boundary.

```python title="approvals.py"
if approval_policy.can_approve(user, request):
    approvals.approve(request)
```

### Type example

The caller asks a named policy instead of rebuilding the condition.

```rust title="src/approvals.rs"
if approval_policy.can_approve(user, request) {
    approvals.approve(request);
}
```

### Typed example

The typed caller uses the named policy boundary.

```ts title="src/approvals.ts"
if (approvalPolicy.canApprove(user, request)) {
  approvals.approve(request);
}
```
