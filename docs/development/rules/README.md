# Reviewed Rule Domains

These generated files contain every reviewed rule from the `development-preferences` repo,
which is the canonical source for this shared rule set. Keep them synchronized from that
repo instead of editing copied rule text by hand.

Use the domain file that matches the current task. Load more than one domain when work crosses
boundaries such as Rust API changes, tests, docs, performance, and source control.
